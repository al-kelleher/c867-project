# C867 - Scripting and Programming: Applications

This was my passing submission for the C867 project. The given scenario is that I was contracted by a university to migrate the existing student database to a newer platform built using C++. This new platform built in C++ will output an array of students. It will print out their data to the console and has methods for validating their data such as email addresses and the like. It can detect any changes made and report back. Essentially this platform can parse, organize, and manipulate student data from long text strings.
